<h1>Glitch Images</h1>
<h2>Collection of liminal spaces, glitched to become even more unsettling.</h2>
<p>Liminality is defined as a state of transition from one stage to another, 
<br>often likened to a rite of passage, but liminality can also be observed in architecture, 
<br>which are what these images focus on, being considered odd spaces that are not meant to be occupied, 
<br>but only passed through.</p>
